# &nbsp;                           Network Fundamentals :



=) Network fundamentals refer to the basic principles and components that make up a computer network. A network is essentially a group of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources.



##### Key Components of a Network :



\- Nodes: These are devices like computers, smartphones, printers, or servers that send or receive data.

\- Links: The physical or wireless connections between nodes. Examples include Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth.

\- Protocols: Rules that govern how data is transmitted (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).

\- IP Addressing: Every device has a unique IP address to identify it on the network.





##### Networking Devices:



\- Router: Directs data between different networks.

\- Switch: Connects devices within the same network and manages data flow.

\- Hub: Broadcasts data to all devices in a network (less efficient than a switch).

\- Access Point: Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.





##### Network Types :



1\. Personal Area Network (PAN)

Definition: A PAN is a small network that connects personal devices within a very limited range, typically around 10 meters.



2\. Local Area Network (LAN)

Definition: A LAN connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, school, or office building.



3\. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

Definition: A MAN covers a larger geographical area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN, typically spanning a city or a large campus.



4\. Wide Area Network (WAN)

Definition: A WAN covers a broad area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.



5\. Campus Area Network (CAN)

Definition: A CAN is larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN, typically used in educational institutions or corporate campuses.







##### OSI Model (7 Layers of Networking) : 



This model helps understand how data travels across a network:

\- Physical – Hardware transmission (cables, signals)

\- Data Link – Error detection and MAC addressing

\- Network – Routing and IP addressing

\- Transport – Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP)

\- Session – Manages sessions between devices

\- Presentation – Data formatting and encryption

\- Application – Interfaces for user interaction (e.g., browsers, email clients)



##### Network Architecture :



\- Client-Server: Central server provides resources to clients

\- Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Devices share resources directly without a central server



#####  Essential Devices :



\- Router: Connects networks and routes data

\- Switch: Connects devices within a LAN

\- Modem: Converts digital data for transmission over telephone lines

\- Firewall: Monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic for security



##### Steps to Build a Network :



\- Define Requirements: Number of users, type of data, security needs

\- Choose Topology: Star, bus, ring, mesh—how devices are physically arranged

\- Select Hardware: Routers, switches, cables, access points

\- Configure IP Addressing: Static or dynamic (via DHCP)

\- Install and Configure Software: Operating systems, network management tools

\- Implement Security: Firewalls, antivirus, encryption

\- Test and Monitor: Ensure performance, troubleshoot issues







##### Security Considerations :



\- Firewalls: Block unauthorized access

\- Encryption: Protect data during transmission

\- Authentication: Verify user identity

\- Antivirus/Anti-malware: Protect endpoints
