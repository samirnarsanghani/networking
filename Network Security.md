# Network Security



###### =) Network security is all about protecting data, devices, and systems from unauthorized access, misuse, or cyberattacks.



##### Key Security Measures



\- Firewalls: Act as gatekeepers, filtering traffic based on rules.

\- Antivirus \& Anti-malware: Detect and remove malicious software.

\- Encryption: Protects data in transit (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs).

\- Access Control: Limits who can access what—using roles, permissions, and authentication.

\- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Monitor and block suspicious activity.

\- Security Patches \& Updates: Regular updates to fix vulnerabilities in software and firmware



##### Best Practices



\- Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.

\- Segment networks (e.g., guest vs internal) to reduce exposure.

\- Regularly audit logs and monitor for anomalies.

\- Educate users on phishing, social engineering, and safe browsing.

\- Implement network segmentation and zero-trust architecture where possible.



##### Network Maintenance

##### 

Maintenance ensures your network remains healthy, optimized, and secure over time.

##### 

##### Routine Maintenance Tasks



\- Update software and firmware: Prevent vulnerabilities and improve performance.

\- Monitor performance: Track bandwidth, latency, and uptime.

\- Backup data: Regular backups protect against data loss.

\- Inspect hardware: Replace aging or faulty components.

\- Review access controls: Ensure only authorized users have access.

\- Audit security settings: Check firewall rules, encryption protocols, etc



##### Benefits of Routine Maintenance Tasks :



\- Prevents downtime

\- Enhances performance

\- Improves security posture

\- Reduces long-term costs



# &nbsp;                        Troubleshooting Procedures





###### =) Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing and resolving network issues to restore normal operations.





##### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting:



\- Identify the Problem: Gather information—what’s not working, who’s affected, and when it started.

\- Check Hardware: Inspect cables, routers, switches, and power sources.

\- Use Diagnostic Tools:

\- ipconfig (Windows) – Check IP configuration.

\- ping – Test connectivity to other devices.

\- tracert – Trace the path packets take to a destination.

\- Review Logs: Look at system and network logs for error messages.

\- Isolate the Issue: Determine if the problem is local, network-wide, or external (e.g., ISP).

\- Apply Fixes: Restart devices, reconfigure settings, or replace faulty components.

\- Test \& Document: Confirm the issue is resolved and document the solution for future reference.
